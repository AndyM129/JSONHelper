JSONHelper
==========

Lightning quick JSON deserialization for iOS &amp; OS X written in Swift.

Purpose
--------------

There are wonderful third party libraries out there that let you get data from an API end-point easily in just a couple lines. Wouldn't it be cool if deserializing that data was always just as easy, or perhaps even easier? Well, it is with JSONHelper! The sole purpose of JSONHelper is to make serializing super easy even when working with data with lots of optional parameters and nested objects.

__Requires iOS 7 or later.__
