JSONHelper
==========

Lightning quick JSON deserialization for iOS &amp; OS X written in Swift. Expanded upon the ideas found in [this blog post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/efficient-json-in-swift-with-functional-concepts-and-generics).

Purpose
--------------

There are wonderful third party libraries out there that let you get data from an API end-point easily in just a couple lines. Wouldn't it be cool if deserializing that data was always just as easy, or perhaps even easier? Well, it is with JSONHelper! The sole purpose of JSONHelper is to make deserializing super easy even when working with data with lots of optional parameters and nested objects.

__Requires iOS 7 or later.__

Installation
--------------

I plan to support [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) when it starts working with Swift libraries. Until then, as a quick and easy (yet a birt dirty) method, I recommend directly adding [JSONHelper.swift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isair/JSONHelper/master/JSONHelper/Pod%20Classes/JSONHelper.swift) into your project.
